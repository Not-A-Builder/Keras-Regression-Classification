# Keras-Regression-Classification
Demonstration of how to use the Keras library in Deep Neural Networks to solve Regression as well as Classification Problems.

Inside the Dataets folder, you will find the 2 requisite datsets in .csv format:

• hourly_wages_data

• diabetes_data

The code for demonstration of Keras usage is in .ipynb format, in the file DL_Keras_Regression-&-Classification.ipynb, and the same notebook contains the code for Regression problem and also the Classification problem.

## But what IS Keras?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
