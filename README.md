Demonstration of how to use the Keras library in Deep Neural Networks to solve Regression as well as Classification Problems.

Inside the Dataets folder, you will find the 2 requisite datsets in .csv format.
• hourly_wages_data
• diabetes_data

The code for demonstration of Keras usage is in .ipynb format, and the same notebook contains the code for Regression problem and also the Classification problem.
