## Regression

Regression predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to a continuous output variable (y).

A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer or floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes.

For example, a house may be predicted to sell for a specific dollar value, perhaps in the range of $100,000 to $200,000.

• A regression problem requires the prediction of a quantity.  
• A regression can have real valued or discrete input variables.  
• A problem with multiple input variables is often called a multivariate regression problem.  
• A regression problem where input variables are ordered by time is called a time series forecasting problem.

## Classification

Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).

The output variables are often called labels or categories. The mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation.

For example, an email of text can be classified as belonging to one of two classes: “spam“ and “not spam“.

• A classification problem requires that examples be classified into one of two or more classes.  
• A classification can have real-valued or discrete input variables.  
• A problem with two classes is often called a two-class or binary classification problem.  
• A problem with more than two classes is often called a multi-class classification problem.  
• A problem where an example is assigned multiple classes is called a multi-label classification problem.

## Classification Vs Regression

Demonstration of how to use the Keras library in Deep Neural Networks to solve Regression as well as Classification Problems.

Inside the Dataets folder, you will find the 2 requisite datsets in .csv format:

• hourly_wages_data

• diabetes_data

The code for demonstration of Keras usage is in .ipynb format, in the file DL_Keras_Regression-&-Classification.ipynb, and the same notebook contains the code for Regression problem and also the Classification problem.

## But what IS Keras?

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

### Very importantly, Keras has been comprehendably documented at https://keras.io/
